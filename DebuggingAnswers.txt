Put your answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1:
finish : 'C'
numDisks: 5
start : 'A'
temp : 'B'
totalMoves : 28672

Q2:
makeTheMagicHappen() called the solveTowersOfHanoi function and it was defined in the TowersOfHanoiGUI.cpp file.

Q3:
31 total moves

Q4:
15 total moves

Q5:
A 2 character input because the program starts to output strings that are longer than the original input.

Q6:
It shouldn't be += chosen but just +.

Q7:
If for example our first input is 'ad' and we keep += chosen, then chosen starts acting like the addition of a new character
a option itself. So if we run the program through the debugger and we choose 'a', then once the program runs through permutationsRec
they will add 'a' as chosen then run through again with '' as remaining and 'ad' as chosen. However, the program will run once more through
with 'a' being remaining and 'ad' as chosen and output an unnecessary result causing the bug because the program thinks 'ad' as a whole
is a character, not the following recursive case which causes another output of 'ada' in the end.Therefore, if we change += to +,
then the program will recognize that the addition of 'd' is another recursive case and not add the extra 'ada' and treat it as an addition
of a character rather than it being a character itself.
